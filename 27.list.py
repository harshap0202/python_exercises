# introduction to lists exercises
# Do all of this in a .py file in Pycharm.
# Create a variable and assign it a list that contains an integer, a float, a Boolean value, a string, and a list of 3 integers.
multi_list = [11, 3.4, True, "Harsh", [10, 20, 30]]

# Create another variable and assign it a call of the list() function with a string as its argument.
string_list = list("This is a string in list")

# Use the keyword "in" to check if the letter "e" is in the list assigned to the variable from step 2 and print the result.
print("e" in string_list)

# Use the keyword "not in" to check if the letter "a" is not in the list assigned to the variable from step 2 and print the result.
print("a" in string_list)
